    <p>
      A year ago, I reached out to Elizabeth Yin of hustle fund, via email to
      share with her this new thing that I have been working on.. Partly I was
      so excited because we were making a considerable amount of money already
      and we were even profitable as early as it was. It was the NextGenHub,
      which is solely a tutoring company that just offered tutoring for kids. I
      was so much inspired by the success of goStudent that I convinced myself
      there was a possibility to conquer the markets that gostudent wasn’t
      operating in. And I still think there is a chance. In the email, I laid
      down a sneak into our numbers (although they weren't very much) and had
      very high expectations for what her reply email would be.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don’t want to ever lose the child in me. You know, the closest friends I
      have are very few. And they happen to be way older than me. And when I
      meet with any of them, we have a couple of drinks, wine, too many and
      another, and another. And we just have so much fun! Sometimes we talk
      about business, other times we don’t even know what we are talking about.
      We are all drunk.. And it's some of the best times of my life!
    </p>
    <p>
      After some wait, she replied to me. For context, I had already been in
      contact with her via the same email during my time of running a fintech
      startup called ‘Zyde’. Went nowhere. Team lost morale after spending lots
      of time working on the product without any funds, amongst other reasons.
      Here’s her most profound reply I got in the email I sent:
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Hi Eric - I think the big question you have to answer is how is this
      differentiated? Everyone is in this space: Chipper, Payday, Kuda, some of
      our portfolio cos, etc… Lower fees don't win against well-funded players,
      and often there’s a reason fees aren’t low / ppl don’t compete on price. ‘
    </p>
    <p>
      Now with this new tutoring service, I expected a better response. Here’s
      what she sent to me:
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Thanks Eric! I think it comes down to what you want. If you want to build
      a VC-backed business, I don’t think this is an idea that will get VC
      funding. In the US, this space is incredibly crowded. Bets have already
      been made. Everything from Synthesis School (Elon Musk’s startup) to
      Outschool (well funded) to ActivityHero (marketplace for kids activities,
      of which there are many mom and pop coding classes on there), to
      Codecademy / Udemy / Codedex / et al which are strong alternatives — this
      space is completely saturated, and there are already great solutions in
      the US for this. ’
    </p>
    <p>
      I read this clearly. And to be honest I misunderstood her. We were already
      making money. Isn’t that clear signal that there is a demand out there for
      a tutoring service?
    </p>
    <p>
      We brushed it off, and she advised that I could run the tutoring service
      as a side business and get the cash flow. I agreed with her at this point
      and still somewhat assured her that I would come back with $20k in MRR
      after 6 months. Boy, did reality hit me so quickly. Today marks a year
      since that email and we have barely made that amount of money in total.
      And I am writing this because I just had a huge realization that I think
      could have saved me a lot of time that I also think will be beneficial to
      you reading somewhere in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      I just closed an Ad that I put on instagram for the tutoring service.
      Great ad. And it's summer. Who doesn’t want a verified online tutor for
      their child in preparation for next academic year? It’s been hours now and
      I am burning a considerable amount of cash on the ad, and I have gotten
      zero App Installs. What could be the reason? I thought about this a lot.
      It's not that my target audience is not there, maybe there are just no
      ones seeing the ads. Even when I have specified them. This flashed back to
      me in a mild thought, what Elizabeth wrote to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking back at the above snippets of Elizabeth’s email. One phrase
      remains dominant; Well-funded players. She used the same phrase for When I
      was working at the fintech startup, and at the tutoring startup. The naive
      me thought we could win because we had a better product. Transactions were
      free and the product was better (in the case of the fintech product) and
      For the tutoring App, existing customers loved us and our main customer
      acquisition channel was through referral – I mean, your customer gotta
      love you enough to refer you right? I thought we were going to win in both
      cases. It has now occurred to me, after a year, that I was wrong. It’s
      hard to admit it, but I was. When she used well-funded players,my brain
      shallowly translated it to mean that the competitors are just big because
      they had more money. I didn’t think deep into what that meant. I am doing
      it now. After a year. She didn’t mean that I didn’t have a better product,
      rather It was pure logic that we wouldn’t win. Let’s do the math.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. In the beginning, you start out with this great product that your first
      10 customers love so much and appreciate you for. They even go ahead and
      refer you to their friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Sooner or later, the referrals come to a halt and you no longer are
      getting as much inbounds as you used to.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The only logical next step is to start putting in money to acquire the
      customers. They are not coming free anymore.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Where do you advertise? What comes to mind>> Social media and Google
      Ads. Billions of people are on there daily, your customers are there, you
      only need to let them know you exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Now, you start marketing on social media and google ads. One thing
      becomes clear sooner or later. The same customers that you are marketing
      to, via keywords or interests, are the same target for the bigger players.
      They want even more attention from the same demographics. How then, does
      google decide which company to prioritise? Well, it's simple, the one with
      more dollars. Cost per click goes up and because the bigger companies have
      a lot of cash to burn, they effectively bid higher and take up the
      priority for all these advertising channels and you are once in a while
      thrown a bone to suck on.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. This is the reality. Not fair, maybe, but it's the reality. They are
      well funded simply means, they are willing to pay more to whichever
      platform you are both marketing with to make sure their ads are
      prioritised over yours. Doesn’t matter if your product is better.
    </p>
    <p>What’s Next?</p>
    <p>
      For now, I am just going to keep the tutoring ‘NextGenHub’ product running
      organically just for the cash flow, then I will leverage this cash flow to
      fund Fasua for now, which is a Maths Self-Learning program for kids.. With
      this new product, I am thinking of unconventional customer acquisition
      channels that are even more effective and not as brutal as traditional
      social media and google ads. This way, I get to compete with the bigger
      players also in this space without it being a factor of who has more money
      to spend.
    </p>
    <p>With respect, Easy!</p>
