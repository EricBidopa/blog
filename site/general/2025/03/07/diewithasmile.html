      I don’t want to ever lose my smile. Maybe that is why I love spending time
      with kids so much. They are just able to do absolutely dumb things and
      still enjoy the beauty of it. It’s incredible!
    </p>
    <p>
      I don’t want to ever lose the child in me. You know, the closest friends I
      have are very few. And they happen to be way older than me. And when I
      meet with any of them, we have a couple of drinks, wine, too many and
      another, and another. And we just have so much fun! Sometimes we talk
      about business, other times we don’t even know what we are talking about.
      We are all drunk.. And it's some of the best times of my life!
    </p>
    <p>
      But then I see people their age on the street, going about their day so
      raw and too serious. Zero sense of humor! So dry! Almost as if they curse
      every single day they wake and realize they're still alive. And Resent so
      much getting themselves off the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I look at them and I think to myself; Is this an age thing? Does life just
      get so boring and dreadful as you grow up? If I have any choice in it, I
      don’t want to turn into that as I get older.
    </p>
    <p>
      I want to still be able to see the beauty in the little things. The simple
      pleasures of life, you’d say. I want to laugh as hard as I can at good
      jokes. I want to be able to do dumb things, realize they are dumb and
      laugh at myself. In my old age, I want to still be able to connect with my
      grandkids, understand their jokes, have fun with them, and crack jokes
      with them. I want to laugh at jokes they make about me being in a
      wheelchair! Of course the better not do too much, lest they get cut off
      the trust fund. haha!
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a beautiful old ghanaian movie that always is painted beautifully
      at the back of my mind that I can’t quite confirm if I really watched or
      was just a dream. It comes to mind whenever I think in this direction; A
      father of 4 kids, on his dying bed with not more than 3 inhales left to
      go. With his last breath, he whispered, “My daughters, come closer, I have
      a secret to share. I hid gold at the center of the family farm. Please go
      and share.” And with that, he passed away with a smile. They couldn’t
      quite understand the smile. Yet they spent the next 1 year of their lives
      digging the entire farm in search of the gold and found nothing. Ha! What
      a legend! The kids burst into laughter when they realized it was a joke.
      Old man’s last wish is for them to keep smiling and laughing. On my dying
      bed, I want to be that man! Embrace death! Crack a joke! Make fun of my
      own death. A life lived too long. I want to die with a smile!
    </p>
    <p>With respect, Easy!</p>
