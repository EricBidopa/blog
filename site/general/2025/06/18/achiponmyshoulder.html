      <p>Going to keep it very short, for now. Lot of unresolved trauma</p>
      <p>
        I grew up in a low income household in the Eastern Region of Ghana, a
        small town called Monrovia. I had a pretty rough childhood. I was
        maltreated and went through a lot of pain inflicted by my mom. Why?
        Well, my parents divorced when I was about 4 as they used to fight a
        lot. Dad was never around. I just sadly got the wrong gene card and
        ended up having similar phenotypes as my dad. The game was rigged
        against me, before I even knew I was playing it, you might say. She
        would just look at me and get pissed every time. I reminded her of her
        trauma with my Dad. I can recall a number of times she told me she
        wished I was dead. Not here to play the victim card. So as you can
        imagine, growing up around such pain, forces you to do extra to impress.
        I always have a chip on my shoulder. And the only thing that would be on
        my mind every single morning is independence. I went to school starving
        a number of times and would solve homeworks for class mates and get paid
        for it. Had to get creative.
      </p>

        Fast forward, I hustled my way to get my first phone in highschool and
        started learning some digital skills with it. Learned how to write (or
        at least watched endless videos on it, every day all night), Picked up
        some marketing skills. About that time, the crypto industry was picking
        up. So I, again, hustled my way into getting hired by a crypto company
        as a social media manager and soon after that made enough money to get
        my first laptop. Then I started learning coding with it. I kept saving
        what I earned. And when it was time for uni, I applied to Gordon
        University in the USA, got admitted, Got a not-full scholarship and
        since we couldnâ€™t pay the fees still, I dropped out and decided to give
        Ghana university a try. Got admitted into a Ghanaian university, and I,
        again, dropped out in the first month and finally got the escape that I
        had been yearning for. I had saved up enough money to rent an apartment
        and survive on for a year (If I was being careful). So I weighed my
        options, staying in school and spending 4 years of my life finishing a
        course and later competing with colleagues that had connections to get a
        Job, or drop out and trust that I could figure things out. I chose the
        latter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fast forward, I built a number of websites for people, made some more
        money and started a couple of companies here and there when I saw an
        opportunity. A lot is to share but not ready to. Will edit and update this at the right time.
