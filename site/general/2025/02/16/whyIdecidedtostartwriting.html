      I have always had a lot to say about many things. Most of the time, I
      prefer to conserve my energy, be lazy, and just keep it in. I wouldn&#39;t
      dare risk saying things with words that are not immaculate. I would rather
      not say anything at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The times that I have explained things with the perfect words, I have felt
      truly good and confident. I loved that feeling. And in those moments, I
      wished I could do it more.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have had many intensely emotional moments in my life—some that bring
      tears and others that stretch my lips into a smile. In every one of these
      moments, when I pay enough attention, I notice a tiny thought crawling in
      my mind, shouting in its tiny voice that I should write about it or at
      least put into words how I am feeling. It is always hard for me. I brush
      it off. Always.
    </p>
    <p>
      The very few times that I have written, I have realized that I feel
      genuine peace and a clear mind. I speak more clearly, and it feels good.
      In the moment. Well, not when I look back at it a couple of weeks later
      and cringe so badly. Maybe this is why I have decided to start writing a
      lot. Maybe I like the clarity and articulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I bought my first motorbike in January 2024. I never imagined that I would
      be a biker. I only bought it as an investment—and because I could at that
      time. The first few days after the purchase, I spent learning to ride the
      damn thing. My best friend&#39;s elderly brother (who is no longer on
      speaking terms with me) taught me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first ride was the most incredible experience I had ever felt. Feeling
      the sun and the wind blowing in my face. My sweat drying up in an instant.
      I felt like I could die at any moment on the damn thing. And still felt
      free.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since that experience, you’d most likely always see me on a motorbike. I
      loved it, and I still do. I have had about three crashes already, and keep
      riding. My Instagram feed is filled with Ducatis. Am I starting this
      writing journey because I love motorbikes? Maybe not.
    </p>
    <p>
      A couple of months ago, after some good reading, I decided that I would
      start taking things more seriously and be more intentional about my life.
      Well, I have always been a philosophy guy. I have a different outlook on
      life. Well, I think everybody does. But mine has never been a strict,
      straight one. It has always been a mixture of little things I like from
      others. And I mostly don&#39;t care to put it into words because, as I
      alluded to above, I fear I may not use the right words. Which may end up
      sending me down a deep, dark hole of existentialism. Or at least, I like
      to think so.
    </p>
    <h3 id="-1-motorbikes-and-the-future-">
      <strong>1. Motorbikes and the Future</strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
      I think that in the foreseeable future, I am going to keep riding
      motorbikes. And I like to think that I am comfortable with the idea of
      having riding accidents that may cost me a leg or two. Most people rarely
      lose their hands; it is mostly the legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have noticed that certain experiences in my past and my worldview have
      made me more susceptible to nihilism. I have been there many times, and I
      have made a decision to aim up—even when nothing and everything makes
      sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Connection:</strong> If I end up in a crash that costs me a leg, I
      would still like to keep aiming up. I would like to have some sort of
      meaning, still. I have come to accept the fact that bad things happen. All
      the time. And when they do, in that instant you have two options; cry and
      sob in regret of the loss or cry once and move one without regret. I would
      like to choose the later. However, I have noticed that the mind and the
      heart often are at war. The mind assures that there are brighter days
      ahead but the heart just would not look beyond the moment. In an effort to
      convince my heart of that fact, I think I would need some reference of all
      the down moment that I have had in the past, remind it that it felt the
      same way then, and we still had some good times afterwards. That's it. I
      want this blog to be an account of all the striking moments that I have on
      this earth so I can refer to as memories are easy to forget by the brain
      without assistance. Plus, I think being in a wheelchair while writing
      brilliant novels and philosophies would be a good one.
    </p>
    <h3 id="-2-writing-clears-my-mind-">
      <strong>2. Writing Clears My Mind</strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
      I have taken on a lot of responsibilities this year, and it gets
      overwhelming sometimes. Writing helps me think clearly. It feels so messy
      in my head, but when I write it out, it get not easy, but simple.
    </p>
    <h3 id="-3-zooming-out-on-life-">
      <strong>3. Zooming Out on Life - Science Fiction?</strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
      A zoomed-out view of life. At most, I have six
      decades left on this floating rock. There is so much I want to get
      done. So much I want to see, touch, feel and build.
    </p>
    <p>
      AI is advancing very quickly. I don&#39;t
      want to live forever, but I love the idea of a version of me still being
      accessible to my family even after I die—for generations. So they can ask,
      and they can have fun with that version of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      In simple terms: if AI can get so good to the point that it can learn
      everything about me—my style of writing, talking, thinking—then I would
      love it. And though I don&#39;t yet see exactly how that would play out, I
      think writing publicly would help make it easier for whatever AI to learn about me.

      <strong>4. Just in Case Someone Needs It</strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
      I think it is good that my thoughts and
      experiences could be publicly available to the world for at least a year
      (before the domain name expires ofcourse). Just in case someone out there might
      enjoy, shed a tear for another smile while reading them. We are humans after-all.
