    <p>
      I have most had a lot more than a little bit to say about a lot of things.
      Most times, I prefer to conserve my energy, be lazy and just keep it in. I
      wouldn&#39;t dare risk sayings things with words that are not spot on. I
      would rather not say at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The times that I had explained things with the perfect words, I felt
      trully good and confident. I loved that feeling. And in that moment wish I
      could do it more. But i don&#39;t.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have had a lot of intensely emotional moments in my life. Some that
      share a tear and some that stretches my lips. In every one of these
      moments, when I pay attention, I notice a tiny thought crawling in my
      head. Shouting with it&#39;s tiny voice that I write about it or at least
      explain in my own words how I am feeling. It is always hard for me. I
      brush it off. Always.
    </p>
    <p>
      The very few times that I write, I have realised I feel genuine peace in
      me and a clear mind. I speak more clearly znd it feells good. In the
      moment. Well, not when I look back at it couple of week later and I cringe
      so badly. Maybe this is why I have decided to start writing a lot. Maybe I
      like the clear mind feeling and the articulation. Or maybe not.
    </p>

      I bought my first motor bike in 2024 - January. Never imagined that I
      would be a biker. I only bought it as an investment. And because I could,
      at that time. First few days after the purchase, I spent on learning to
      ride the damn thing. My best friend&#39;s elder brother (Whom is no more
      in talking terms with me) taught me.
    </p>
    <p>
      First ride was the most incredible experience that I had ever felt.
      Feeling the sun, and the wind blowing in my face. My sweat all drying up
      in an instand. I felt like I could die any moment on the damn thing. I
      felt free.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since that experience you&#39;d most likely always see me on a motor bike.
      I loved it and I love it. I have had about three crashes already. But I
      still keep riding. My instagram feed is filled with Ducatis. Am I writing
      because I love motor bikes? Maybe not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Couple of months ago, I decided, after some good reading that I would
      start taking things more seriously and being intentional about my life
      more often. Well, I have always been a philosophy guy. I have a different
      outlook on life. Well, I think everybody does. But mine has never been a
      strict straight one. It has always been a mixture of littles that I like
      from others. And I mostly don&#39;t care put it into words because as I
      alluded to above, I fear I may not use the right words. Which may end up
      sending me down a deep dark whole of existentialism. Or at least I like to
      think so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here&#39;s Why I think I have decided to start writing my thoughts (in no
      particular order).
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        I think In the foreseable future, I am going to keep riding motor bikes.
        And I like to think that I am comfortable with the idea of having riding
        accidents that may cost me a leg or two. Most people rarely loose their
        hands. it is mosty the legs.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      I have noticed that certain experiences in my past, and my world-view has
      made me more liable to nihilism. I have been there many times I am have
      made a decision to aim up. Even when nothing and everything makes sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      connection: If I end up in a crash, that costs me a leg, I would like to
      still keep aiming up. I would like to have some sort of meaning, still.
      And I think being in a wheel chair and writing brilliant novels,
      philosophies, would be a brilliant one.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Writing clears my mind. I have taken a lot of responsibilities this
          year and I gets overwhelming somethings. Writing helps me think
          clearly. It seems so messy in my head. write it out and it is so
          simple. Not easy. But simple.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          I have been taking a zoom-out view on life lately. I have at most six
          decades left on this giant floating rock. There is so much I want to
          get done. I want to have a lot of kids. A.I is advancing very quicky.
          I don&#39;t want to live forever, but I would like the idea of a
          version of me. still accessible to my family even after I die. for
          generations. So they can ask that can have fun with that version of
          me. In simple terms; if A.I can get so good to the point that it can
          learn everything about me, my style of writing, talking, thinking,
          then I would love it. And thought I am not seeing how that would work
          yet, I think writing publicly would help make it easier for him to
          learn about me.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If point 3, doesn&#39;t spun out, I still think it is good that my
          thoughts and experiences could be publicly available to the world for
          a year more (domain name expires). Just in case someone may need it
          out there.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Cheers to more beautiful time. Life is Good.</p>
    <p>with Respect,</p>
