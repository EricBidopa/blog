    <p>Hello Ms Pene,</p>
    <p>
      I trust this finds you well. You don’t know me, so below are some details
      about me.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      My name is Eric, based in Accra. I dropped out of university after my
      first year to pursue software engineering (self-learning) and startups at
      18. For the past 4 years, I have been here and there building software
      startups across software edtech, fintech and proptech. I think I have
      finally built something that I believe is truly impactful. Check it out
      <a href="https://www.fasuaglobal.com" target="_blank">here</a> (fasuaglobal.com),
      helping children learn maths easily.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Plot twist – I am not asking for employment or trying to pitch you
      (although I wouldn’t mind). I rather, want to join ACTT school on a
      scholarship if you’d be so kind as to accommodate me. Specifically the
      woodwork and joinery multi-months program.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      Why scholarship? Well, I am living hand to mouth basically. I earn just
      enough to go by and not any extra to spend on education. My rent is due
      soon and Landlord’s take 2 years advance these days and even with me being
      self-employed building websites for other companies every now and then to
      go by, it is very tough to have extra for anything. So let’s just say I am
      not too good on the financial side right now. But I am willing to dedicate
      and put in my best to learn the woodwork craft.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      Ofcouse, from one business person to the other, In return, I would also be
      more than willing to take over your institute’s website, manage it, and
      handle any technical changes that may be required, in hopes that I could
      repay your kindness which I very well know is priceless. Plus, If need be,
      I can start working on an App for you and contribute my skills in any way
      to position ACTT at the forefront of innovation. And that is not all. This
      leads to the “Why Woodwork?” Question, which I have thought long and hard
      about.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      You see, I have always been interested in furniture. Specifically the more
      classical and antique ones. I was raised by my grandmother in the eastern
      region before moving to Accra and I appreciated the timeless furniture all
      around her house. I think the world is slowly fading them away and I would
      like to help preserve that. After school, my plan is to go the
      self-employed route and combine my software skills to establish a modern
      furniture company with modern technology. A.I, Augmented reality and the
      likes. You have my word. I will do exactly that if you give me this
      opportunity. A gentleman’s word. So maybe, if all goes well and I don’t
      die, an extra return on your scholarship investment will be me providing
      employment opportunities for a lot of my peer graduates which would also
      align with your mission a lot. Thank you for taking the time to read this.
      I tried to keep it as succinct as I could. Looking forward to hearing from
      you.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />

    <p>Regards</p>
    <br />
    <p>E.B</p>
