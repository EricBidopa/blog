      Magical Products With God-Complex
    </h1>
    <p>
      In content below; I think = current thinking and subject to change people
      == most people
    </p>
    <p>
      For a while now, I have consistently caught myself lost in the thought of
      what the phrase, &#39;works like magic‘ actually means. Partially because
      I am working on a high-potential product (Zyde) and I want it to be the
      best it can be. And, of course, people use the phrase a lot, so I got
      curious to know what it means. I never got a grip on it. Everyone slaps
      the phrase on any new product feature, even if it doesn&#39;t give off the
      ‘magic’ feel. Or is it that any product that works == ‘works like magic’?
      Well, here’s what I think:
    </p>
    <h2 id="how-i-came-by-what-i-think">How I came by what I think</h2>
    <p>
      A week ago, the introverted me randomly decided to go out for once on
      Christmas Eve—just random walks, nothing much. I watched a couple of
      YouTube videos that I&#39;d downloaded and started the stroll.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cold weather, tucked-in shirt, and me. After a couple of turns through an
      almost empty street (as everyone was inside celebrating Christmas), I came
      upon a crowd so focused on something in the centre == origin (if you
      will). Whatever that thing was seemed to have piqued their interests on an
      unimaginable level. So, you guessed it. I took an extra couple of steps to
      find out.
    </p>
    <p>
      I peeked over and saw a magician performing what seemed to be magic. Not a
      big fan of magic. But I must say, the magic really caught my attention. I
      stood there for close to an hour with the crowd. Thirty minutes in, it
      occurred to me — My logical/rational self knew 100% that it was a trick
      and nothing ‘supernatural’. After asking around, to my surprise (jokes on
      me), most of the crowd <em>also</em> knew it wasn’t supernatural. But they
      just allowed the novelty to be. It felt like we all allowed ourselves a
      moment. Just enjoy, don’t think. Just enjoy. Just a moment of not
      overthinking. It turned out to be one of the most amazing moments of my
      entire 2023. It was truly surreal with all the adrenaline rush. I got home
      and was still ecstatic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then it hit me. I had experienced magic. Can I now connect things and
      finally understand what ‘works like magic’ really means? Maybe it&#39;s
      all about the feeling. Of course, not the
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘adrenaline’ part, but that genuine moment where I didn’t have to
      overthink. Just take it all in. Though I knew it was definitely a trick, I
      didn’t want to decode it. I just liked that it was immaculate. The concept
      finally started making sense to me.
    </p>
    <h2
      id="below-are-some-products-that-i-concluded-are-magical-from-my-realisation-"
    >
      Below are some products that I concluded are magical from my realisation:
    </h2>
    <p>
      Video games -/FIFA - Nobody wants to understand the codes and the game
      physics that power it. We press a key on a gamepad /controller, and a
      player on a screen can move its leg to hit the ball. How magical could
      this get?
    </p>
    <p>
      Air-conditioner - The average person(usually the majority) has no idea
      about the principle of phase conversion’, and I could bet that 90% of
      people going to read this piece don&#39;t even understand what it is.
      Maybe, including you. Yes, you. The point is people don’t care, want to
      care or have to care about how it works under the hood. We turn it on, and
      it does ONE thing. Blow a cool breeze. And that’s that. A hot/warm room
      immediately feels cold—a ‘magical’ product.
    </p>
    <p>
      Internet Browsers /- Search Engines - when you type ‘www.google.com’ into
      a browser, what happens? After seconds, we see Google’s website with all
      its content on our screen. This is magical. So, let’s learn what goes on
      under the hood. Your computer sends a request to the Domain Name System
      (DNS) server. The browser then sends a request to the server to establish
      a connection using the IP. The server receives the request and sends a
      message acknowledging the request to establish a connection. At this
      point, only a connection has been established. You are probably getting
      bored; if you are not, you are among the few who like technicalities.
      Well, another extra process goes on that can retrieve packets of Google’s
      website code before the code is translated into something readable. All
      this happens in a split second, and the above is just a summary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagine if Chrome showed you all the above to your face before you finally
      accessed ‘google.com’.
    </p>
    <p>
      E.g. ‘ packet retrieval from 8.8.8.8 initiated’ or ‘Encryption initiated
      via Secure Sockets Layer with 8.8.8.8’. Imagine how much of a weird
      experience that would be. You’ll most probably stop using Chrome and
      consider another browser. At that point, Chrome will still be a functional
      browser. Gets you access to all the websites that other browsers do, but
      the thing is, it will be appealing to only developers, who make up less
      than 1% ( well, technically 0.36% ) and not the general public.
    </p>
    <p>
      Browsers and Search Engines have scaled this much because they’ve done a
      fantastic job hiding the technicalities. You don’t see what you don’t NEED
      to know.
    </p>
    <h2 id="keeps-the-novelty-magical-products-">
      Keeps the novelty. Magical products!
    </h2>
    <p>
      You can also make a clear case study for Phone calls(How ISP/ Telecom
      work) and Cars as being magical products.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve been a strong proponent of the so-called ‘web3’ industry for a long
      time now. Worked professionally in the space. Here’s what I think needs to
      happen for the industry to scale:
    </p>
    <h2 id="magical-products-are-what-build-the-future-">
      Magical Products are what build the future.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I think current crypto products are like ‘Chrome, showing packet retrieval
      from 8.8.8.8 initiated’. Appealing to less than 5% (Well, actually 4.2%)
      of the entire population, yet throwing ‘onboarding the next 1 billion
      people on-chain’ all over landing pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reality turns out being that ~95% of the people (the remaining
      population) probably don’t even know what ‘on-chain’ means or care to find
      out. The product may be solving a key problem they are facing, and they
      could be super loyal customers if they used the product. But the barrier
      between where they are and where they could be is the ‘perception’. ”I
      don’t know what on-chain and gas fee means. It&#39;s not for me.”
      meanwhile, the product could enable them to have part ownership in a real
      estate asset with as little as 1 dollar without having to sign any tedious
      documents and with a click of a button, sitting on a couch from 10,000
      kilometres away. And they would LOVE IT. A whole world of possibilities
      gets locked away from them because of their ‘perception’ of what the
      product does.
    </p>
    <p>
      I realised a while ago that ‘what your product does’ and ‘what people
      think your product does’ are two different things. And more often than
      not, what people think your product does turns out to be more important
      than you think.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also believe education is the least of the problems with crypto. Of
      course, the brain is constantly looking for patterns to learn from.
      Synapses are constantly being modified. Sadly, to learn something is not
      entirely up to the brain&#39;s synapes, especially when we are emotional
      creatures, and we have something called ‘mood’ which is highly influenced
      by externals.
    </p>
    <p>
      People don’t like to learn. As much as we may want to believe otherwise,
      learning FEELS hard, and it sucks to wander around in an unknown field,
      especially when you’re at risk of losing money.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think the product UI/UXs are the problem. Crypto products have to be
      designed in a way that people don&#39;t need to know how it works. It just
      naturally fits into the lives they are used to or at least not far away
      from the life they are used to. Maya principle is required.
    </p>
    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      People don&#39;t want to know how it works. If &#39;gas-fees&#39;,
      &#39;transaction hash&#39;, &#39;block&#39;, and &#39;nonce&#39; are
      constantly slapped on people’s screens, not only does it remove the
      god-complex (novelty) from it. It also makes most people feel dumb when
      using your product. People don&#39;t want to see strange words that get
      them confused. As humans, If we see strange words, we start to think that
      maybe if we knew those strange words, then we could understand. Deep down,
      we wish we didn&#39;t want to understand as learning feels uncomfortable.
      That&#39;s why only a few people go on to search what &#39;block&#39;,
      &#39;gas-fee&#39;, and &#39;hash&#39; means, and the rest just uninstall
      the products and who knows how it&#39;s tagged in the brain — ‘weird’,
      ‘refrain’ could be an understatement, or a little worse: ‘ not smart
      enough to use it’.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think magical products aren&#39;t about making something that
      doesn&#39;t exist. It is more about making something that may or may not
      exist so good that it feels like an actual human being, that understands
      what exactly you want to see or experience and provides you just that with
      your palm in it&#39;s hands. It should just work and make people okay with
      not knowing how it works.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thought of understanding how that human works
      <em>feels</em> impossible, even if it’s an easy concept under the hood. It
      is the novelty and appreciation for the unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love that it works now—and it always works, and I don&#39;t want to know
      how it works. Because I feel it will be really hard to understand. Focus
      on the hole and not the drill -Wise man Nubi Kay once alluded.

    <p>With respect, Life is Good.</p>
