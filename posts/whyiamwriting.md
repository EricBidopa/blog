## **Why I Decided to Start Writing**

I have always had a lot to say about many things. Most of the time, I prefer to conserve my energy, be lazy, and just keep it in. I wouldn't dare risk saying things with words that are not spot on. I would rather not say anything at all.

The times that I have explained things with the perfect words, I have felt truly good and confident. I loved that feeling. And in those moments, I wished I could do it more. But I don't.

I have had many intensely emotional moments in my life—some that bring tears and others that stretch my lips into a smile. In every one of these moments, when I pay attention, I notice a tiny thought crawling in my head, shouting in its tiny voice that I should write about it or at least put into words how I am feeling. It is always hard for me. I brush it off. Always.

The very few times that I have written, I have realized that I feel genuine peace and a clear mind. I speak more clearly, and it feels good. In the moment. Well, not when I look back at it a couple of weeks later and cringe so badly. Maybe this is why I have decided to start writing a lot. Maybe I like the clarity and articulation. Or maybe not.

I bought my first motorbike in January 2024. I never imagined that I would be a biker. I only bought it as an investment—and because I could at that time. The first few days after the purchase, I spent learning to ride the damn thing. My best friend's elder brother (who is no longer on speaking terms with me) taught me.

The first ride was the most incredible experience I had ever felt. Feeling the sun and the wind blowing in my face. My sweat drying up in an instant. I felt like I could die at any moment on the damn thing. But I also felt free.

Since that experience, you’d most likely always see me on a motorbike. I loved it, and I still do. I have had about three crashes already, but I keep riding. My Instagram feed is filled with Ducatis. Am I writing because I love motorbikes? Maybe not.

A couple of months ago, after some good reading, I decided that I would start taking things more seriously and be more intentional about my life. Well, I have always been a philosophy guy. I have a different outlook on life. Well, I think everybody does. But mine has never been a strict, straight one. It has always been a mixture of little things I like from others. And I mostly don't care to put it into words because, as I alluded to above, I fear I may not use the right words. Which may end up sending me down a deep, dark hole of existentialism. Or at least, I like to think so.

Here’s why I think I have decided to start writing my thoughts (in no particular order):

### **1. Motorbikes and the Future**
I think that in the foreseeable future, I am going to keep riding motorbikes. And I like to think that I am comfortable with the idea of having riding accidents that may cost me a leg or two. Most people rarely lose their hands; it is mostly the legs.

I have noticed that certain experiences in my past and my worldview have made me more susceptible to nihilism. I have been there many times, and I have made a decision to aim up—even when nothing and everything makes sense.

**Connection:** If I end up in a crash that costs me a leg, I would still like to keep aiming up. I would like to have some sort of meaning, still. And I think being in a wheelchair while writing brilliant novels and philosophies would be a brilliant one.

### **2. Writing Clears My Mind**
I have taken on a lot of responsibilities this year, and it gets overwhelming sometimes. Writing helps me think clearly. It feels so messy in my head, but when I write it out, it becomes so simple. Not easy. But simple.

### **3. Zooming Out on Life**
Lately, I have been taking a zoomed-out view of life. At most, I have six decades left on this giant floating rock. There is so much I want to get done.

I want to have a lot of kids. AI is advancing very quickly. I don't want to live forever, but I love the idea of a version of me still being accessible to my family even after I die—for generations. So they can ask, and they can have fun with that version of me.

In simple terms: if AI can get so good to the point that it can learn everything about me—my style of writing, talking, thinking—then I would love it. And though I don't yet see exactly how that would work, I think writing publicly would help make it easier for AI to learn about me.

### **4. Just in Case Someone Needs It**
If point 3 doesn’t pan out, I still think it is good that my thoughts and experiences could be publicly available to the world for at least a year (before the domain name expires). Just in case someone out there might need them.

Cheers to more beautiful times. Life is good.
