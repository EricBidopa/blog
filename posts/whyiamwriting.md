## Why I decided to start writing

I have most had a lot more than a little bit to say about a lot of things. Most times, I prefer to conserve my energy, be lazy and just keep it in. I wouldn't dare risk sayings things with words that are not spot on. I would rather not say at all. 

The times that I had explained things with the perfect words, I felt trully good and confident. I loved that feeling. And in that moment wish I could do it more. But i don't. 

I have had a lot of intensely emotional moments in my life. Some that share a tear and some that stretches my lips. In every one of these moments, when I pay attention, I notice a tiny thought crawling in my head. Shouting with it's tiny voice that I write about it or at least explain in my own words how I am feeling. It is always hard for me. I brush it off. Always. 

The very few times that I write, I have realised I feel genuine peace in me and a clear mind. I speak more clearly znd it feells good. In the moment. Well, not when I look back at it couple of week later and I cringe so badly. Maybe this is why I have decided to start writing a lot. Maybe I like the clear mind feeling and the articulation. Or maybe not. 

I bought my first motor bike in 2024 - January. Never imagined that I would be a biker. I only bought it as an investment. And because I could, at that time. First few days after the purchase, I spent on learning to ride the damn thing. My best friend's elder brother (Whom is no more in talking terms with me) taught me. 

First ride was the most incredible experience that I had ever felt. Feeling the sun, and the wind blowing in my face. My sweat all drying up in an instand. I felt like I could die any moment on the damn thing.  I felt free. 

Since that experience you'd most likely always see me on a motor bike. I loved it and I love it. I have had about three crashes already. But I still keep riding. My instagram feed is filled with Ducatis. Am I writing because I love motor bikes? Maybe not. 

Couple of months ago, I decided, after some good reading that I would start taking things more seriously and being intentional about my life more often. Well, I have always been a philosophy guy. I have a different outlook on life. Well, I think everybody does. But mine has never been a strict straight one. It has always been a mixture of littles that I like from others. And I mostly don't care put it into words because as I alluded to above, I fear I may not use the right words. Which may end up sending me down a deep dark whole of existentialism. Or at least I like to think so. 

Here's Why I think I have decided to start writing my thoughts (in no particular order). 

1. I think In the foreseable future, I am going to keep riding motor bikes. And I like to think that I am comfortable with the idea of having riding accidents that may cost me a leg or two. Most people rarely loose their hands. it is mosty the legs. 

I have noticed that certain experiences in my past, and my world-view has made me more liable to nihilism. I have been there many times I am have made a decision to aim up. Even when nothing and everything makes sense.

connection: If I end up in a crash, that costs me a leg, I would like to still keep aiming up. I would like to have some sort of meaning, still. And I think being in a wheel chair and writing brilliant novels, philosophies, would be a brilliant one. 

2. Writing clears my mind. I have taken a lot of responsibilities this year and I gets overwhelming somethings. Writing helps me think clearly. It seems so messy in my head. write it out and it is so simple. Not easy. But simple. 

3. I have been taking a zoom-out view on life lately. I have at most six decades left on this giant floating rock. There is so much I want to get done. I want to have a lot of kids. A.I is advancing very quicky. I don't want to live forever, but I would like the idea of a version of me. still accessible to my family even after I die. for generations. So they can ask that can have fun with that version of me. In simple terms; if A.I can get so good to the point that it can learn everything about me, my style of writing, talking, thinking, then I would love it. And thought I am not seeing how that would work yet, I think writing publicly would help make it easier for him to learn about me. 

4. If point 3, doesn't spun out, I still think it is good that my thoughts and experiences could be publicly available to the world for a year more (domain name expires). Just in case someone may need it out there. 


Cheers to more beautiful time. Life is Good.
