## Some of us are not engineers.


Some of us are not engineers. We are what I believe Jack likes to call Hackers.


Force us to write one complete function in JavaScript without the internet, and it will take us more than a minute.


Give us access to the internet, and we can build fully functional protocols in a week.


Take us away for a week from the same protocol we wrote, and it will take us another week to wrap our heads around our own codebase.


We don’t care about the programming language itself. We care about what we want first. We can learn a new language over a weekend just to build the functionality we envision.


We have the grit to search and find, to get disappointed and revive hope, to learn and unlearn. We can be completely convinced we cannot do it in one moment, and then get it done in the next. 

We can feel worthless one minute and unstoppable the next. We learn by doing, and we never finish tutorial videos completely.
We think we want to build products for the money. But soon, we realize we do it for the challenge.


Enough money to buy our favorite food, favorite drinks, and pay our bills—that’s all we need. Not cars, not power, not excess. Though we understand it’s good to have.


But we have flaws. We constantly see challenging opportunities, and we find ourselves working on more than we can humanly handle.


We are prone to more impulsive behaviors than others, and we understand that it is fine and we are working on it. We don’t forgive ourselves when we make mistakes. And we don’t stop believing in ourselves and possibilities.

We tend to lose inspiration to see a product through to the very end—especially once we’ve solved the challenging part. Hence, so many unfinished projects.

We are hackers! The world needs more hackers!
We focus on the hole, not the drill!
