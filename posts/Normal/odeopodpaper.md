# Odeopod Paper

Media globalism is the ultimate invention created by humanity. As I write, In just a snap, anyone with a phone and internet connection gets to connect with billions of people globally, consume their content, learn about them, their views and get an idea about their philosophy. 

Majority of context consumed on social media are video. I think video is the laziest way to get your brain to understand something. Audio without video, I think is the best. I have been an intense consumer of podcasts. I have notice the different being that listening to podcasts only gets my brain to be more focused and infact as opposed to video content, enhances my attention span. I think that there should be one platform that just focuses on audio. all kinds of audio. At least to balance out the media type equation. I think there is a market for it and people have just not realized it yet. So I am going to start working on an audio only streaming app. The platform will contain all kinds of audio (podcasts, music, ASMR, etc). Maybe not musix. Music has a lot of copyright rules I don't want to have a bite of that yet. Maybe later. 

But odeopod shouldn't just be another audio streaming app. I think for a long time revenue earning has been one-way and I would like to try to make odeopod two-ways. Which is; both creator and listener should get the chance to earn the audio. It is quite evident to me that this is possible with the blockchain, although I have not yet figured out how it is going to work entirely. 

Here's how it should work for a great economy:

1. On sign up, I want to be able to mint my shares on the app. 
2. After minting, I get, say 1000 $EricBidopa. 
3. Now I can go on an upload audio content and then as the number of listeners of my audio goes up, and gets popular, the value of my shares goes up.
4. Other users are then able to buy some of my shares as a way to invest into the prospect of my channel doing good in the future. 
5. These investors are then motivated to share the content with other userrs to also check out my account since they are more incentivized to do it. 
6. These investors earn as my podcasts also gets more popular and get to also trade with other people who want to buy. 




This way, creator makes money and more motivated to put out quality content, and fans make money and more motivated to share the quality content with either new or existing users. 

Win-Win Economy. 

As time goes one, I would love for people to decide what recommendation algorithm they prefer.
