#Hold on Dear Life. 

One more time.
Hold on old friend. 
We’ve had our share of fleeting joys.
But sorry wouldn't be enough. 

I got it this time, I thought. 
Yet, here we are again. 
I thought I had it this time. 
Yet, here we are again. 

I searched but found nothing.
"What will we eat tomorrow?" you ask.

Our last scraps are fading fast.
My hands are tied.

I am tired. 
There’s no tapping out.

I long for someone to blame.
Who do I blame. 

There he is. You, I blame. 
But you are me. 

We are bound, you and I.
Hold on, old friend—
Just one more night.
