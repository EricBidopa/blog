# Aim Up. 

Regrets. Pain. A lot of it. Famliy Loss. Stupid mistakes. "Why is it so hard?". Wrong place wrong time. You don't get out alive. Lost love. Many worse where many more. Where do you look? 

What are your options?

Feel the sad about it now, remember tomorrow and remember to feel the pain. Said now, is fine. Sad tomorrow reduce efficiency tomorrow and reduction in efficiency adds up to existing sad. Efficiency comes to zero and sadness gets to 90. One way path to an abyss. Abyss is painful and the world suffers effects of the pain with you. 

Why is it wrong? it is wrong because you are subjecting your mind to pensive sadness, when you could free yourself of it at least and spare the world of the effects. 

Aim up. Cry ones, move on. No refrets, no shame. Die once, Die ready. Aim up increases efficiency, efficiency brings more smiles to you and the world. Better to smile than frown. Smile is tolerate. Frown isn't. 

You have only one option; Aim up. If it is pain you desire, life has enough to offer at right times even when you aim up. That's a constant. Aim up. No regrets. You have the world to conquer. Be optimistic. Put things in order where you are. Keeps life balanced.
