## Die with a Smile


I don’t want to ever lose my smile. Maybe that is why I love spending time with kids so much. They are just able to do absolutely dumb things and still enjoy the beauty of it. It’s incredible!

I don’t want to ever lose the child in me. You know, the closest friends I have are very few. And they happen to be way older than me. And when I meet with any of them, we have a couple of drinks, wine, too many and another, and another. And we just have so much fun! Sometimes we talk about business, other times we don’t even know what we are talking about. We are all drunk.. And it's some of the best times of my life! 

But then I see people their age on the street, going about their day so raw and too serious. Zero sense of humor! So dry! Almost as if they curse every single day they wake and realize they're still alive. And Resent so much getting themselves off the bed. 

I look at them and I think to myself; Is this an age thing? Does life just get so boring and dreadful as you grow up? If I have any choice in it, I don’t want to turn into that as I get older.

I want to still be able to see the beauty in the little things. The simple pleasures of life, you’d say. I want to laugh as hard as I can at good jokes. I want to be able to do dumb things, realize they are dumb and laugh at myself. In my old age, I want to still be able to connect with my grandkids, understand their jokes, have fun with them, and crack jokes with them.  I want to laugh at jokes they make about me being in a wheelchair! Of course the better not do too much, lest they get cut off the trust fund. haha!


There is a beautiful old ghanaian movie that always is painted beautifully at the back of my mind that I can’t quite confirm if I really watched or was just a dream. It comes to mind whenever I think in this direction; A father of 4 kids, on his dying bed with not more than 3 inhales left to go.  With his last breath, he whispered, “My daughters, come closer, I have a secret to share. I hid gold at the center of the family farm. Please go and share.” And with that, he passed away with a smile.  They couldn’t quite understand the smile. Yet they spent the next 1 year of their lives digging the entire farm in search of the gold and found nothing. Ha! What a legend!  The kids burst into laughter when they realized it was a joke. Old man’s last wish is for them to keep smiling and laughing. On my dying bed, I want to be that man! Embrace death! Crack a joke! Make fun of my own death. A life lived too long. I want to die with a smile!
