## Why is good better than bad. 


## My Philosophy on life: 

The minute you are born, you are a debtor. You owe the world for the very ability to quantify time into minute. For the very knowledge of birth passed over from over a millenia. To whatever it is that made sperms know to swim and eggs know to get fertilized by sperms. Whatever it is that knows to start a chain of reactions to make you cry at the taste of pain inflicted in the labor room. To whoever that thought to make the room available. To whatever complex social constructs and whatevery sophisticated reaction in the brain that causes you to smile or worst, laught at a good joke. The list goes on and on and one. from infite chain of knowlegde, to tools, to technology. It was either created by a being dead or alive. And you are here. Enjoying every bit of it. Reading this from a rectangular screen. Which by some chance also enables you to hear the voice of your loved ones from kilometers away. It is all hard, painful work and a lot of things going right at the exact right time. 

Well, on the flip side, the very ability quantify time in minute enables us to know when we are running late and makes us nervous sometimes. The doctor slap my butt is painful, couldn't there be less painful approaches to get the same results? I didn't even want to be born. Would be far better if I didn't exist at all. knowledge passed on from millenia are used to create same bombs that destroy us. Same earth also dances sometimes and causes people to die. 


The point remains; For every good thing that we should be grateful for being able to enjoy, there is also a bad caused by it that we spite. Although maybe not in proportional intensity. 

How do you go about life is everything good also cause bad? 
Which translate to; should we go about life grateful, ergo Happy or go about life sad that all the good things also causes bad? 


Let's go about life Happy: 
Happy make you able to do more good. 







1. Good feels good completey. and Bad feels good sometimes. 
2. Good makes you happy and happy gives you a stronger stamina. 
3. Stronger stamina means you get to share infinite positivity with other around you and it will require a lot more intense challenge to get you to be in sour mood. Which means you get to get a lot more done. A lot more done means higher chance of creating infinite inpact for living creatures. 



We are debtor; You should stive to do thing that would outlive you and cause infinite inpact on lives. It should outlive you. 

Thing way, life becomes more and more bearable and less and lesser people wish the weren't born at all.
